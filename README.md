## :seedling: Self-taught Programmer && a Lifelong Learner

I'm a :fr: French Web and Mobile developer, living in Marseille, France. Self-taught by nature, I like to develop complex web and mobile applications while learning new techniques each day. Passionate about technology and its value, I have a great desire to build a product that can solve people's problems at scale.
